## Blockchain Security

[Majority is not Enough:Bitcoin Mining is Vulnerable](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ie53/publications/btcProcFC.pdf) - The Bitcoin cryptocurrency records its transactions in a public log called the blockchain. Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentivecompatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed. *Note: The attack vector referred as selfish mining was identified before this academic paper was released describing the attack. If you know where the source of the original report is, please include it.*
